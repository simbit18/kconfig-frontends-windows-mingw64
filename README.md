## Overview
UVC Ingenieure https://github.com/uvc-ingenieure/kconfig-frontends made an amazing job by figuring out how to build kconfig-mconf.exe for Win32 platforms.  Reclone Labs has adding CMake build support for kconfig-conf.exe and a functional draft of kconfig-tweak.bat <https://github.com/reclone/kconfig-frontends-win32>.

This GitHub Actions Workflow builds kconfig-mconf.exe for Win64 platforms uses the great job of Reclone Labs.
